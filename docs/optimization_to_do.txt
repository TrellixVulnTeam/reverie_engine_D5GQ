OPTIMIZING

pass as much by const ref as possible, EVEN shared pointers

order things from small size to large, big cache win

do not return with a move, compiler will handle it

emplace for in place contruction (e.g., replace push_back with emplace_back), using template extensions

pre-reserve vectors to avoid thrashing

lists are very wasteful, terrible locality of reference


make enums enum classes for safety

replace uniform constructor with template
