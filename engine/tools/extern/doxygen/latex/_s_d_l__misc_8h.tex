Open an U\+RL / U\+RI in the browser or other. 

Open a U\+RL in a separate, system-\/provided application. How this works will vary wildly depending on the platform. This will likely launch what makes sense to handle a specific U\+RL\textquotesingle{}s protocol (a web browser for \href{http://,}{\texttt{ http\+://,}} etc), but it might also be able to launch file managers for directories and other things.

What happens when you open a U\+RL varies wildly as well\+: your game window may lose focus (and may or may not lose focus if your game was fullscreen or grabbing input at the time). On mobile devices, your app will likely move to the background or your process might be paused. Any given platform may or may not handle a given U\+RL.

If this is unimplemented (or simply unavailable) for a platform, this will fail with an error. A successful result does not mean the U\+RL loaded, just that we launched something to handle it (or at least believe we did).

All this to say\+: this function can be useful, but you should definitely test it on every platform you target.
