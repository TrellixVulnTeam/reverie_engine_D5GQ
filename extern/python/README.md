Python distributions are obtained by installing with the windows installer for both 32 and 64 bit versions.

See: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#embedded-distribution

Also see todo-python-embeded.md in this folder: https://gist.github.com/rgl/72b60fc12f91c93c0d286d56ae19e324

I already do this with setup_python.bat (woo)
